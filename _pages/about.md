My name is Jacob Keller and I'm a Graduate Research Associate within the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State University. My research interests include human-machine teaming, resilience engineering, and computational modeling. 


My work is highly interdisciplinary, drawing elements of control theory, cognitive psychology, computer science, and systems engineering to analyze complex sociotechnical systems. In my graduate studies, I hope to contribute to the development of novel engineering methodologies to increase the resilience of human-machine teams performing high-complexity, high risk activities such as space operations.

*NASA's Astrobee Simulation Framework is being explored as a testbed for human-robot interaction studies*

At the most basic level, I'm interested in understanding how to support interaction between teams performing complex work. By understanding the nature of interactions within work I believe that we can design more resilient systems to support these teams. This would include identifying specific features of work that would correlate with resilient behavior within human-machine teams. 

Here are some of the relationships I'm interested in exploring in my work:
- Costs of coordination associated with different information exchange modes or communication strategies
- Relationships between human and machines agents working towards common goals
- Resource limitations, goal tradeoffs, and delegation of authority and responsbility

My interest in computational modeling and simulation relates directly to these pursuits, as a computational framework offers a low-overhead test bed for analyzing tradeoffs and complexities within work, provided ample care is taken in creating an ecologically valid representation of the work environment at hand. 

Emerging methods for simulating the dynamics of work in human-robot teams could guide the development of sophisticated systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed past their performance boundaries, as discussed in [Keller and IJtsma, 2021](https://jkeller52.github.io/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf). In general, a more methodical, ecologically valid, and interdisciplinary approach is necessary to advance our robotic capabilities. No amount of centralized planning or software profenciency will make the perfect system, therefore the paradigm shift towards the modular, contextually-aware adaptive system is necessary. 


Robust, resilient, and decentralized human-robot systems will pave the way towards advanced operations within distributed teams, facilitating the ablity to dynamically delegate authority, responsibility, and taskloads to other agents in the midst of rapidly shifting demands common in uncertain and complex environments.

  <figcaption> This concept art from NASA shows astronauts working in close proximity with robotic agents. The precise details of how they work together are one example of my research interests. How many robots should assist an astronaut performing surface EVA tasks? How is control handed off between astronauts? What is the authority delegated to the robot to make decisions based on software rules and sensor inputs?</figcaption>
