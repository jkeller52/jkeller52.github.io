My name is Jacob Keller and Iâ€™m an undergraduate researcher at Ohio State University. My research interests span multiple fields, drawing elements of computer science, cognitive psychology, visual analytics, and systems engineering. These interests coalesce within the emerging field of Cognitive Systems Engineering, offering valuable analytic frameworks and theoretical support for the design of human-machine systems within complex work domains. I graduated with a B.S. in Human Systems Integration in December 2020, and plan on beginning graduate studies in Cognitive Systems Engineering in Fall 2021.

My Research
======

My interests primarily lie in leveraging the strengths of cognitive systems engineering to bridge technical gaps in manned space operations. The design of human robot teams to traverse planetary surfaces during extra-vehicular activity (EVA) is an area of particular interest, as many questions surrounding the characteristics of the ideal human-robot team will surely be raised as the upcoming Artemis missions begin to take shape. Emerging methods for simulating the dyanmics of work in human-robot team performing complex tasks could guide the development of sophisticated human-robot systems that exhibit resilient behavior when pushed beyond traditional performance boundaries. In general, the careful and prescient design of human-robot systems will make it easier for astronauts to dynamically delegate authority and responsibility as the demands of the task at hand evolve and change.

This work and related topics will comprise the majority of my graduate studies. I am looking forward to embarking upon this journey, and am excited to see the results and overarching themes that this work can contribute to ongoing discussions surroduning the design and implementation of increasingly prevalent autonomous systems.
