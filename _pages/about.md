Cognitive Systems Engineering: Defining the Software Capabilties and Human Machine Systems of Tomorrow
======

This is filler text for my first paragraph. My name is Jacob Keller and I’m an undergraduate researcher at Ohio State University. My research interests span multiple fields, drawing elements of computer science, cognitive psychology, visual analytics, and systems engineering. These interests coalesce within the emerging field of Cognitive Systems Engineering, offering valuable analytic frameworks and theoretical support for the design of human-machine systems.
Complexity is a double edged sword
Rather than assuming (implicitly or explicitly) that human operators will be able to account for problems that arise within work, cognitive engineering aims to identify pitfalls and complexities within work so we can support operators when it matters most: often in highly risky work domains such as space operations, nuclear power, and healthcare. Though these domains are intrinsically complex, it’s been proven that experts use hig-level functionally abstract reasoning to navigate their environment.
Through designing interfaces which recognize the complexity of work, we can create integrated decision support for problem-solving which frames information in the most ideal fashion for that particular work environment. Scholars in this area believe revolutionary information systems can be achieved to support high consequence and complexity work domains (several companies create these decision support systems, mostly supporting intelligence analysts facing data overload conditions). In this fashion, we can make complexity a double-edged sword to wield in the face of a dynamic and unpredictable world.
