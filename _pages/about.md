This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Cognitive Systems Engineering: Defining the Software Capabilties and Human Machine Systems of Tomorrow
======

This is filler text for my first paragraph. My name is Jacob Keller and I’m an undergraduate researcher at Ohio State University. My research interests span multiple fields, drawing elements of computer science, cognitive psychology, visual analytics, and systems engineering. These interests coalesce within the emerging field of Cognitive Systems Engineering, offering valuable analytic frameworks and theoretical support for the design of human-machine systems.
Complexity is a double edged sword
Rather than assuming (implicitly or explicitly) that human operators will be able to account for problems that arise within work, cognitive engineering aims to identify pitfalls and complexities within work so we can support operators when it matters most: often in highly risky work domains such as space operations, nuclear power, and healthcare. Though these domains are intrinsically complex, it’s been proven that experts use hig-level functionally abstract reasoning to navigate their environment.
Through designing interfaces which recognize the complexity of work, we can create integrated decision support for problem-solving which frames information in the most ideal fashion for that particular work environment. Scholars in this area believe revolutionary information systems can be achieved to support high consequence and complexity work domains (several companies create these decision support systems, mostly supporting intelligence analysts facing data overload conditions). In this fashion, we can make complexity a double-edged sword to wield in the face of a dynamic and unpredictable world.
