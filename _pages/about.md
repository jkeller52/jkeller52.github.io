Cognitive Systems Engineering: Defining the Software Capabilties and Human-Machine Systems of Tomorrow
======

My name is Jacob Keller and Iâ€™m an undergraduate researcher at Ohio State University. My research interests span multiple fields, drawing elements of computer science, cognitive psychology, visual analytics, and systems engineering. These interests coalesce within the emerging field of Cognitive Systems Engineering, offering valuable analytic frameworks and theoretical support for the design of human-machine systems. I graduated with a B.S. in Human Systems Integration in December 2020, and am beginning graduate studies in Cognitive Systems Engineering in Fall 2021.

Rather than assuming (implicitly or explicitly) that human operators will be able to account for problems that arise within work, cognitive engineering aims to identify pitfalls and complexities within work so we can support operators when it matters most. It has proved a viable avenue to support operators in highly risky work domains such as space operations, nuclear power, and healthcare, among others. 

Through designing interfaces which recognize the complexity of work, we can create integrated decision support to frame the information required for problem-solving in an incredibly salient fashion. Scholars in this area believe revolutionary information systems can be achieved to support high consequence and complexity work domains (several companies create these decision support systems, mostly supporting intelligence analysts facing data overload conditions). Through the careful engineering of decision support systems we can enable experts to wield their complex mental model of their domain to their advantage. This makes complexity a double-edged sword, rather than a hindrance, and allows us to wield it in the face of a dynamic and unpredictable world to enable new levels of expert performance and behavior.
