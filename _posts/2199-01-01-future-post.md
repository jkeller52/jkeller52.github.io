Cognitive Systems Engineering: What It Is, and What It Has To Say
======

Cognitive Systems Engineering is an emerging field that offers novel perspectives on traditional systems engineering practices. It considers the world as a complex adaptive system, highlighting the role of the agents within the work system and their interactions as crucial drivers towards new system states. It often seeks to identify various types of constraints (resource-based, cognitive, organizational, etc) in order to support the design of tools and systems that exhibit resilience in the face of challenging circumstances.

Rather than assuming (implicitly or explicitly) that human operators will be able to account for problems that arise within work, cognitive engineering aims to identify pitfalls and complexities within work so we can support operators when it matters most rather than expecting them to rise to unsurmountably difficult scenarios. It has proved a viable avenue to support operators in highly risky work domains such as space operations, nuclear power, and healthcare, among others.
