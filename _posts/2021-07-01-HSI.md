In December 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Human Systems Integration (HSI), the first degree of its kind to ever be awarded from Ohio State University. 


HSI is traditionally understood as a multi-disciplinary field of study drawing elements from human factors engineering, system safety, cognitive psychology, and systems engineering. It has deep roots in the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition process, and is considered integral part of a total system approach to weapon systems development. In this light, it is also understood to be a process by which  human capabilities and limitations are effectively integrated. The [Army](https://www.acqnotes.com/Attachments/HSI%20and%20ESOH%20Handbook%20for%20Pre%20MS%20A%20JCIDS%20and%20AoA%20Activities.pdf?_ga=2.130816399.1695205953.1625250278-595137530.1625250278), Navy, and [Air Force](https://www.acqnotes.com/Attachments/Air%20Force%20Human%20System%20Integration%20Handbook.pdf?_ga=2.138026672.1695205953.1625250278-595137530.1625250278).It also has been used by the Department of Transportation recently [DoT HSI Report]

Bridging HSI to Theory and Demilitarized Contexts
======
For the purposes of my degree, HSI is a general term referring to the interdisciplinary field of study concerned with the interaction of humans and machines. It highlights an interaction and interdependence focused approach to building advanced systems meant to do work in complex environments like manned space operations, disaster response, air traffic control, healthcare, and others. 

Increasing popularity of HSI and related ideas is certainly a positive force to support the development of more advanced technologies. That being said, traditional HF views assocaited with HSI lag greatly behind the state of the art. 


Criticisms of HSI:
------
1) HSI 



The Navy's Human Systems Integration program was initially founded to increase the capabilities of autonomous machines, and holds significant philosophical baggage which ignores the complexities and interdependence associate with performing joint work.  [(Bradshaw et al., 2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260304859_The_Seven_Deadly_Myths_of_Autonomous_Systems)



Naval Postgraduate School's [Certificate in HSI](https://nps.edu/web/dl/cert_hsi), though their use of the term differs greatly in its focal point and underlying philosophy ([this comes to mind](https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/), as well).

Headings are cool

Aren't headings cool?
