In December 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Human Systems Integration (HSI), the first bachelor's degree of its kind to to be awarded from Ohio State University.
## What is Human Systems Integration?
HSI is traditionally understood as a multi-disciplinary field of study drawing elements from human factors engineering, system safety, cognitive psychology, and systems engineering. It has deep roots in the Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition process, and is considered integral part of a holistic approach to systems development. In this light, it is also understood to be a process by which human capabilities and limitations are effectively integrated. The [Army](https://www.acqnotes.com/Attachments/HSI%20and%20ESOH%20Handbook%20for%20Pre%20MS%20A%20JCIDS%20and%20AoA%20Activities.pdf?_ga=2.130816399.1695205953.1625250278-595137530.1625250278), [Navy](https://nps.edu/documents/104395560/0/hsi_Masters_brochure_web_150427.pdf/42354142-4937-4155-a2f2-4346589438ff?t=1446069280000), and [Air Force](https://www.acqnotes.com/Attachments/Air%20Force%20Human%20System%20Integration%20Handbook.pdf?_ga=2.138026672.1695205953.1625250278-595137530.1625250278) recognize the importance of HSI and cite it as a key aspect of developing capabilities.

My take on HSI
===
For the purposes of my degree, HSI is a general term referring to the interdisciplinary field of study concerned with the interaction of humans and machines. It has roots in the above mentioned fields, though also goes beyond traditional human factors to include aspects of control theory, computer science, and resilience engineering. It highlights an interaction and interdependence focused approach to building advanced systems, recognizing the complexity of work environments such as manned space operations, disaster response, air traffic control, and healthcare in order to build systems that promote adaptive behaviors in the face of challenges.


### Traditional HSI and Human Factors Leave Something to Be Desired
Increasing popularity of HSI and related ideas is certainly a positive force to support the development of more advanced technologies. That being said, traditional HF views associated with HSI lag greatly behind the state of the art, often considering the purpose of their endeavors to be the elimination of "[human error](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA492127.pdf)". 


One such HSI tradition is that of the US Navy, whose Human Systems Integration program was initially founded to increase the capabilities of autonomous machines. Scholars have noted that this idea holds significant philosophical baggage, almost completely ignoring the complexities and interdependence inherent in multi-agent teamwork [(Bradshaw et al., 2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260304859_The_Seven_Deadly_Myths_of_Autonomous_Systems). There are also examples where this philosophy [fell short of expectations](https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/), as the implications of automating mission-critical technologies are often overlooked when approaches like [function allocation](https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1169062.pdf) or [Sheridan & Verplanck (1978)]()'s levels of automation (which he later himself [criticized](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1555343417724964) as a guiding system design framework).

Other cool idea, synthetic neurons  
Pylyshyn 1980, Cole and Foelber 1984, Chalmers 1996, we might wonder about hybrid systems. Pylyshyn writes:

If more and more of the cells in your brain were to be replaced by integrated circuit chips, programmed in such a way as to keep the input-output function each unit identical to that of the unit being replaced, you would in all likelihood just keep right on speaking exactly as you are doing now except that you would eventually stop meaning anything by it. What we outside observers might take to be words would become for you just certain noises that circuits caused you to make.
