During the pandemic, I finally decided to take the leap into the world of PC gaming. I've always loved console gaming, but was curious and decided it would be a fun project to build my own computer. This computer would work well to support my computational modeling and simulation efforts required for my graduate studies, and double as a gaming/cryptocurrency mining rig. 


I knew I didn't have much space on my desk, so it became clear that I needed as small of a build as possible without sacrificing cooling/ventilation performance. I eventually chose the ThermalTake Tower 100 Mini-ITX case. Its 18.2 x 10.5 x 10.5 inch dimensions fit my space nicely, and its verticality was just the right amount of flashiness for my taste. It's a great centerpiece for my custom built maple ambrosia wood desk.
