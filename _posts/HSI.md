In December 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Human Systems Integration (HSI), the first degree of its kind to ever be awarded from Ohio State University. In fact, the only other institution I'm aware of that offers anything somewhat similar is the Naval Postgraduate School's [Certificate in HSI](https://nps.edu/web/dl/cert_hsi), though their use of the term differs greatly in its focal point and underlying philosophy ([this comes to mind](https://features.propublica.org/navy-accidents/us-navy-crashes-japan-cause-mccain/), as well)

For the last several months, I've worked on a proposal for the Nasa Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity 2021 Grant. This fellowship would secure funding for the duration of my doctoral degree, and allow me to pursue an indepedent, student-led research projkects
