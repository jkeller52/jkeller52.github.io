My student team and I performed over eighty semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in government and industry to uncover complexities and pitfalls within current regulatory frameworks associated with Autonomous Flight Safety Systems. This required a detailed understanding of technical and sociotechnical aspects of executing space launches with an emphasis on public safety, and culminated in the development of a policy proposal recommending action from the Federal Aviation Administration.

Following the conclusion of this work, my interest in understanding the technical feasibility and complexities of automating a complex decisionmaking task has resulted in further academic work. An abstract was submitted and accepted to the International Astronuatical Congress 2020 in Dubai, but the paper was later withdrawn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper is still in progress and will be published in 2021.
