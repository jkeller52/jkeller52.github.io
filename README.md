Hello, welcome to my website's GitHub repository. I've adapted this template to suit my academic and professional needs, highlighting my professional profile to this point and ideas for future research. Having little formal computer science background thus far, I've taught myself to navigate GitHub and utilize open-source code to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing professional site that suits my needs. I learned this relatively quickly, and feel satisfied to have developed the skills required to make my own website.
