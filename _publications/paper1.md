ANALYZING RESILIENCE IN HUMAN-MACHINE TEAMS"

permalink: "/files/testbed_requirements_final.pdf"
excerpt: 'Human-machine teams (HMTs) in complex work domains need to be able to adapt to variable and uncertain
work demands. Computational modeling and simulation can provide novel approaches to the evaluation of HMTs
performing complex joint activities, affording large-scale, quantitative analysis of team characteristics (such as
system architecture and governance protocols) and their effects on resilience. Drawing from literature in resilience
engineering, human-automation interaction, and cognitive systems engineering, this paper provides a theoretical
exploration of the use of computational modeling and simulation to analyze resilience in HMTs. Findings from
literature are summarized in a set of requirements that highlight key aspects of resilience in HMTs that need to be
accounted for in future modeling and evaluation efforts.'
